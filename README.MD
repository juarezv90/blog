# Blog project v0.0.1

### Idea:

Design my own personal blog site to accompany my portfolio. Implement features to have new followers added and to allow them to comment and like post.

### Implementation

For this project decided that best way to implement this was to go the full django backend route as well as to allow a few API end points for access to some data for my portfolio.

### Planned Applications
* API endpoints
* Use of Django Templates
* Signup Form
* Tokenizing using Djoser
* Adding Blog plost via built editor
